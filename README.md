***NOTE***: When refrencing files and file paths, I will be using Linux notation, since that is the platform I am developing on.  
Unless otherwise specified, "/" at the beginning of the filepath refers to the root directory of the git repository.  
For example: `/Documents` refers to the "Documents" directory within the root directory of the project.
